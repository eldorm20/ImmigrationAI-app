```

### PHASE 2: Redis (5 min)
```
Action: Add Redis service to Railway
Expected: "Redis connected to redis://..."
```

### PHASE 3: Ollama (30 min)
```
Action: Add Ollama Docker service, configure memory
Expected: "🤖 Ollama initialized", "✅ Model loaded: mistral"
⏳ Wait 20-30 min for model to download
```

### PHASE 4: Tests (5 min)
```
Action: Run 7 verification tests
Expected: All tests pass ✅
Result: Production ready! 🚀
```

## 🎉 You're All Set!

**Everything is prepared and documented.**

The code is production-ready. All you need to do now is:

1. Follow the 4 phases
2. Run the tests
3. Launch! 🚀

**Estimated time: 45 minutes**

Most of that is automated waiting (Ollama pulling the AI model). Your actual work is ~15 minutes of configuration clicks.
