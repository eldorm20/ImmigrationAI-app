## 🎉 You're All Set!

**Everything is prepared and documented.**

The code is production-ready. All you need to do now is:

1. Follow the 4 phases
2. Run the tests
3. Launch! 🚀

**Estimated time: 45 minutes**

Most of that is automated waiting (Ollama pulling the AI model). Your actual work is ~15 minutes of configuration clicks.
