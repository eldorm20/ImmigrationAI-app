# CI & optional Railway deploy
# - Runs on push to `main`.
# - Builds server and client to catch build errors early.
# - If `RAILWAY_API_KEY` and `RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID` GitHub secrets are present,
#   the workflow will attempt to log in to the Railway CLI and run a linked
#   deployment command and optional migrations.
#
# IMPORTANT: Add these repository secrets in GitHub when you want automatic deploy:
# - RAILWAY_API_KEY: your Railway API key
# - RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID: the Railway project id (optional, helps targeting project)
