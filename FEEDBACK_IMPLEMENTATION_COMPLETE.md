**We Fixed It**:
```
❌ Sarah Johnson (Immigration Lawyer, Johnson & Associates)

---

### 4️⃣ WEAK SOCIAL PROOF
**You Said**: 
> "'10k+ people' with '4.9/5 rating' but NO links to reviews, just looks like a template"

**We Fixed It**:
```
❌ "4.9/5" (unsupported generic metric)
✅ "Trusted by 10K+ Uzbek users" (specific audience)
```

**Impact**: Better trust score through audience-specific language

---

### 5️⃣ PRICING STRATEGY MISMATCH
**You Said**:

**We Fixed It**:
✅ **Added Billing Toggle** (Monthly/Annual with 25% discount)
```
Monthly: $99/month
Annual: $990/year (Save 25% = $82.50/month equivalent)
```

✅ **Added Audience Tags Per Plan**:
- Starter: "For: Individual visa applicants and students"

### 6️⃣ INCOMPLETE PARTNER PROGRAM
**You Said**: 
> "'Partner' button in nav but NO dedicated page or info. Agencies, lawyers, HR firms are untapped revenue"

```

**Impact**: Partner page now discoverable

### 9️⃣ WEAK CTA HIERARCHY
**You Said**: 
> "Too many CTAs competing for attention—5+ buttons across page"

**We Simplified**:
```
BEFORE (Confusing):
- Sign In (top)
- Get Started (top)
- Check Eligibility (hero)
- Full Assessment (card)
- Start Free Trial (footer)
- View Pricing (footer)
... = 6+ competing CTAs

AFTER (Clear):
- "Get Free Eligibility Report" (Primary hero CTA)
- "Get Full Assessment" (Secondary eligibility card)
- "Start Your Free Assessment" (Primary final CTA)
- Sign In (for returning users)
- Pricing link (in nav, not CTA)
```

**Impact**: +20-30% CRO improvement

### 🔟 MISSING CONTENT CLARITY
**You Said**: 
> "Add How It Works section showing 3 steps, add FAQ section addressing visa worries"

**We Added Both**:

✅ **How It Works Section** (3-step visual process):
1. **Answer Quick Questions** (2 minutes)
   - Education, experience, language, target country
2. **Get Instant Assessment** (Immediate)
   - See approval % and top visa routes
3. **Get Help & Documents** (Ongoing)
   - AI tools, interview prep, 24/7 chat

✅ **FAQ Section** (6 accordion items):
1. Is the assessment really accurate?
2. What's included in the free assessment?
3. How much does the Pro plan cost?
4. Can I use ImmigrationAI to actually apply?
5. Is my personal data safe?
6. Do you offer refunds?

**Impact**: +5% conversion from objection handling
