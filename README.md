## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- PostgreSQL 16+
- Docker (optional, for local development)
- Railway account (for deployment)

## 🛠️ Local Development

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ImmigrationAI
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/immigrationai
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-in-production
REFRESH_SECRET=your-super-secret-refresh-key-change-in-production
S3_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
S3_ENDPOINT=https://s3.amazonaws.com
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5000,http://localhost:3000
LOG_LEVEL=info
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
```

### 3. Set Up Database

```bash
# Generate migrations from schema
npm run db:generate

# Run migrations
npm run db:migrate
```

### 3.1 Seeding Demo Data

```bash
# Run migrations (if not already) and seed sample lawyers and applications
npm run db:seed
```

### 4. Start Development Server

```bash
# Start both frontend and backend
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

## 🐳 Docker Development

```bash
# Start all services (PostgreSQL + App)
docker-compose up

# Run migrations
docker-compose exec app npm run db:migrate
```

## 🚢 Railway Deployment

### 1. Create Railway Project

1. Go to [Railway](https://railway.app)
2. Create a new project
3. Add a PostgreSQL service
4. Add your application service

### 2. Set Environment Variables

In Railway dashboard, add these environment variables:

- `DATABASE_URL` (automatically set by Railway PostgreSQL)
- `JWT_SECRET` (generate a strong random string)
- `REFRESH_SECRET` (generate a strong random string)
- `S3_BUCKET` (your storage bucket name)
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` (if using S3)
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (if using S3)
- `S3_ENDPOINT` (S3 endpoint URL)
- `AWS_REGION` (S3 region)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` (for AI features)
- `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (your production domain)
- `NODE_ENV=production`
- `PORT` (Railway sets this automatically)

### 3. Deploy

Railway will automatically:
1. Build the Docker image
2. Run migrations on deploy (add to startup command if needed)
3. Start the application

### 4. Run Migrations

After first deploy, run migrations:

```bash
railway run npm run db:migrate
```

## ✅ Post-Deployment Smoke Tests (curl)

After Railway finishes deploying and migrations have been run, verify core features using these steps:

1) Create or login an applicant (if you don't have an account, register one):

```bash
# Register
curl -s -X POST https://<YOUR-APP-URL>/api/auth/register -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"test.user@example.com","password":"TestPass123!","firstName":"Test","lastName":"User"}'

# Login (store access token for next requests)
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST https://<YOUR-APP-URL>/api/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"test.user@example.com","password":"TestPass123!"}' | jq -r '.accessToken')
```

2) Create an application (assessment creates this on the client; or call API directly):

```bash
APP_ID=$(curl -s -X POST https://<YOUR-APP-URL>/api/applications -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"visaType":"Skilled Worker","country":"CA"}' | jq -r '.id')
echo "Created application: $APP_ID"
```

3) Verify that the applicant can list their applications:

```bash
curl -s -X GET https://<YOUR-APP-URL>/api/applications -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" | jq
```

4) Login as a seeded lawyer (seeder creates sample lawyers, default password: `LawyerPass123!`):

```bash
LAWYER_TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST https://<YOUR-APP-URL>/api/auth/login -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"alice.johnson@immigration.com","password":"LawyerPass123!"}' | jq -r '.accessToken')
```

5) Use `me` endpoint to discover the lawyer's ID:

```bash
LAWYER_ID=$(curl -s -X GET https://<YOUR-APP-URL>/api/auth/me -H "Authorization: Bearer ${LAWYER_TOKEN}" | jq -r '.id')
echo "Lawyer ID: ${LAWYER_ID}"
```

6) Assign the app to the lawyer (as a lawyer):

```bash
curl -s -X PATCH https://<YOUR-APP-URL>/api/applications/${APP_ID} -H "Authorization: Bearer ${LAWYER_TOKEN}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"lawyerId\": \"${LAWYER_ID}\"}" | jq
```

7) Verify assigned filter returns the app:

```bash
curl -s -X GET "https://<YOUR-APP-URL>/api/applications?assigned=true" -H "Authorization: Bearer ${LAWYER_TOKEN}" | jq
```

8) Confirm KPI stats reflect the new application and fees:

```bash
curl -s -X GET https://<YOUR-APP-URL>/api/stats -H "Authorization: Bearer ${LAWYER_TOKEN}" | jq
```

Expected results:
- POST /api/applications: 201 with application `id` and `status: new`.
- GET /api/applications (applicant): includes created application.
- PATCH /api/applications/:id by lawyer: returns updated application with `lawyerId` set.
- GET /api/applications?assigned=true (lawyer): includes assigned application.
- GET /api/stats: `newThisWeek` and `totalFees` reflect new application and fee.

If any step fails, check server logs (Railway logs) and ensure environment variables + DB migrations were applied.


Or add to your startup command in Railway settings.

## ⚙️ Automating Railway Environment Variable Changes

You can update Railway environment variables from a GitHub Action that ships with this repository: `.github/workflows/set-railway-vars.yml`.

Required GitHub repository Secrets:
- `RAILWAY_API_TOKEN` — a Railway API token with permission to change variables
- `RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID` — your Railway project id
- `RAILWAY_VARS` — newline-separated KEY=VALUE pairs (example below)

Example `RAILWAY_VARS` value (store as a single secret):
```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxx
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxx
HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN=hf_xxx
HF_MODEL=OpenAssistant/replit-1b-instruct
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/dbname
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
```

How to run:
1. Add the three repository secrets above in GitHub (Settings → Secrets & variables → Actions).
2. Run the workflow from the Actions tab or push to `main` to trigger it. The workflow will login to Railway and set the variables for the configured project.

Security: Keep secrets in GitHub Secrets. Do NOT check secret values into the repository.
